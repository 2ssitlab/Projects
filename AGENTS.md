## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository is currently a blank starter project. It contains only a `README.md` file with no application code, dependencies, or services.

- **No build/lint/test commands** exist yet. When application code is added, update this section with the relevant commands.
- **No services** need to be started for development.
- **No package manager or language runtime** is required at this time.

When the first application or service is added to this repo, this file should be updated with:

3. How to run lint and tests
4. Any non-obvious environment setup or gotchas
